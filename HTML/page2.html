        Hello friends, <br>
        I am Chad Scott. I am a student at Norwich University where my major is cyber security with a concentration in forensics.<br>
            My expected graduation date is 03-2021. Then I plan on pursuing my Masters. This is my first web page, so do not judge to harshly, although helpful criticism is appreciated.<br>
            I got into Cyber security and programming by chance. After finishing my Assosiate in applied science, concentration in industrial maintenance, I went to USI to get a bachelor in programing plc's or robotics. I was told by the schools recrutier that they had accomadating programs. I found out later that they did not. When I was siging up for classes, the closet thing they had to what I wanted was a C# class. I fell in love with how awesome it all can be and my career path changed.<br>
            If you want to know more about me, offer an internship, or just talk about code, feel free to click on the contact me link.
